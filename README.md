# Python-Project-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing salary distributions across various teams, aiming to uncover key insights into salary expenditure patterns and identify any correlation between age and salary.

Objective: To analyze salary data, highlight key trends, and investigate factors affecting salary distribution.
Dataset: The dataset includes information on team, age, and salary. The data was preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.

Key Findings: Identified the team with the highest salary expenditure, explored the relationship between age and salary, and provided insights on salary trends across teams.

Methodology
The analysis was structured into the following steps to achieve accurate insights:

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values to ensure data completeness.
Corrected discrepancies in data, such as formatting issues in columns.
Ensured consistency and integrity, especially in team and salary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Created visualizations and used descriptive statistics to explore the distribution of salary and age.
Compared salary trends across different teams.
Correlation Analysis:

Used scatter plots and calculated the correlation coefficient to study the relationship between age and salary, revealing a weak positive correlation.

Results
Key insights from the project include:

The team with the highest salary expenditure was identified.
A weak positive correlation (0.21) was found between age and salary, suggesting a slight upward trend in salary with age.
Additional trends and patterns in salary distribution across teams were analyzed.

Conclusion
The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of salary distribution patterns within the dataset, with key findings on team-wise salary expenditure and age-related trends. Future analysis could delve into other potential factors influencing salary, like performance or position within each team.
